***V2 MAJOR UPDATE: 23 NOV - 26 DEC 2022 (COMPLETE): ***
***Electrical updates:*** Detailed electronics assembly instructions created; Schematic updated; Code updated; Electronics Bay Assembly video created on YouTube; New files located and kept up to date in GitHub repository; Main Fan Assembly video created on YouTube (link below)

***Mechanical updates:***
Electronics bay and cover to hold regular power supply and fit comfortably the replacement LCD; Entire drive line redesigned with flexural clamping on all rotating blades (except main fan), bores for each connecting shaft to seat concentrically, and added clearance around moving parts; Motor gear and clamp redesigned to be a flexural clamp with snap-in place feature for the gear. Added M3 nut to provide much greater clamping force with the new clamp; Coarse (STL) resolution assembly STL files added to check assembly orientation and configuration - use individual part STL files for higher resolutions print; Master Assembly - V2. STEP file added for further remixing and modifications; Assembly video created on YouTube

 *** ALL UPDATED COMPONENTS ARE MARKED WITH " - V2" ***
