# TurbofanDriver
*** UPDATE IN PROGRESS AUGUST-SEPTEMBER 2024 - HANG TIGHT WHILE THINGS CHANGE, GET ADDED, AND FINALIZE OVER THE NEXT FEW WEEKS***

Here resides the:
  Arduino Control Sketch   - Arduino code used to pgram your Arduino Nano using the Arduino IDE.
  Electrical Schematic     - for you to build your circuit from with lots of notes.
  PCB Gerber ZIP file      - to be uploaded to JLCPCB or PCBWay type online PCB ordering site.
  Bill of Materials        - a detailed list of parts required to build this project, seperated by mechanical, electrical, and 3D printed parts.
  
for the 3D Printable Jet Engine - V3 Turbofan Driver.

Use all V3 files if you are starting this project for the first time.
Use "V2 to V3 Upgrade (no PCB)" files if upgrading from V2 to V3 without going to the new PCB. This folder will stay here as a V2 archive
