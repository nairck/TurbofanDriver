# TurbofanDriver
*** UPDATE IN PROGRESS AUGUST-SEPTEMBER 2024 - HANG TIGHT WHILE THINGS CHANGE, GET ADDED, AND FINALIZE OVER THE NEXT FEW WEEKS***


Here resides various important files for the 3D Printable Jet Engine - V3 Turbofan Driver:

- Control Sketch   	- C/C++ Arduino code used to program your Arduino Nano using the Arduino IDE.
- Control Schematic     - the electrical schematic for the entire circuit with connection details and notes.
- PCB Gerber ZIP file	- to be uploaded to JLCPCB or PCBWay type online PCB ordering site.
- Bill of Materials	- a detailed list of parts required to build this project, seperated by mechanical, electrical, and 3D printed parts.
  

Use all V3 files if you are starting this project for the first time.
Use "V2 to V3 Upgrade (no PCB)" files if upgrading from V2 to V3 without going to the new PCB. This folder will stay here as a V2 archive.
